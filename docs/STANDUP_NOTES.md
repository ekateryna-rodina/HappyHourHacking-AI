## Standup Tips

### For Team Members

- **Be prepared:** Think before standup

### For Team Lead

- **Take notes:** Track blockers
- **Be supportive:** Help remove obstacles
- **Be energizing:** Start the day right!

### Red Flags to Watch For
- ⚠️ Same blocker 2 days in a row
- ⚠️ Team member with nothing to report
- ⚠️ Scope creep ("I'm also working on...")
- ⚠️ Integration issues between squads
- ⚠️ Low energy or morale
