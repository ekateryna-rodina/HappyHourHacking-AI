## 💡 Quick Decisions Framework

When faced with choices, use this:

### Should we build Feature X?
- [ ] Does it show in the demo? → **YES** → Build it
- [ ] Does it show in the demo? → **NO** → Skip it

### Which bug should we fix?
- [ ] Blocks the demo? → **YES** → Fix immediately
- [ ] Blocks the demo? → **NO** → Fix if time permits

### Is this good enough?
- [ ] Does it work reliably in demo? → **YES** → Move on
- [ ] Does it work reliably in demo? → **NO** → Polish more

### Should we refactor this code?
- [ ] Is it demo day? → **YES** → Don't refactor!
- [ ] Is it demo day? → **NO** → Only if it prevents bugs
